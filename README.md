# TMDB Scraping (WIP)

## Objective
In this project, I aimed to collect the information of the movies with the highest ratings from The Movie Database.
I will extract data from themoviedb.org site using Python's request library, make this data readable with the BeautifulSoup library, then store it in a DataFrame and save it in a .csv file with the help of the Pandas library.

## Website
The data is collected from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) which is a community built movie and TV database. Since my focus was on the top rated movies, I scraped [Top Rated Movies](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/top-rated) page.

## Dataset
Details can be found [here](https://github.com/muscak/web-scraping/tree/master/Dataset).
