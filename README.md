# Web_Scraping (WIP)

## Objecttive
In this project, I aimed to collect the information of the movies with the highest ratings from The Movie Database.
I will extract data from themoviedb.org site using Python's request library, make this data readable with the BeautifulSoup library, then store it in a DataFrame and save it in a .csv file with the help of the Pandas library.

### Website
[themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/top-rated)

## Dataset
The below fields are stored:
- ID
- Title
- Director
- Release_Year
- Original_Lang
- Main_Genre
- Genres
- Runtime
- User_Score
- Ratings
- Budget
- Revenue
- URL
